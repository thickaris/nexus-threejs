## Dependencies

### vcglib

[VCG library](https://github.com/cnr-isti-vclab/vcglib) needs to be found in the same directory as the `nexus` directory.

```sh
git clone git@github.com:cnr-isti-vclab/vcglib.git
```

### corto

[Corto](https://github.com/cnr-isti-vclab/corto)

```sh
git clone git@github.com:cnr-isti-vclab/corto.git
```

Corto can be installed (in linux) after compilation:

```sh
cmake ./
make
sudo make install
sudo ldconfig
```

or placed in the parent directory of Nexus, in which case you need to add  `../../../corto` to the `include_directories` line in these files

* `./src/nxsbuild/CMakeLists.txt`
* `./src/nxsedit/CMakeLists.txt`
* `./src/nxsview/CMakeLists.txt`

### glew

See [Glew](https://github.com/nigels-com/glew) for build instructions.

```sh
git clone git@github.com:nigels-com/glew.git
```

or

```sh
brew install glew
```

Again if glew is compiled and not installed, you need to add the include directory in CMakeLists.txt for nxsedit, nxsview and nxsbuild:

```
include_directories(../../../vcglib ../../../vcglib/eigenlib  ../../../glew-2.1.0/include )
```

## On MacOS

### install xcode

Download from App Store and Open Xcode to initialize.
Then install the command line tools

```sh
xcode-select --install
```

### install cmake

```sh
brew install cmake
```

And in `settings > Build,Execution,Deployment > CMake` add CMake options:

```
-D CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=/your/path/to/Qt/5.11.1/gcc_64/lib/cmake
```

### install pkg-config

```
brew install pkg-config
```

### install qt5 and get path

```sh
brew install qt5
# copy the path
brew info qt5
# run cmake with qt5 path flag or add flag to shell
cmake . -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=/usr/local/Cellar/qt/5.12.3
```

Within `CMakeLists.txt` you might have to add glew to the `include_directories` line:

```
include_directories(../../../vcglib ../../../vcglib/eigenlib ../../../glew-2.1.0/include )
```


## Build using QMAKE

The .pro files

* `src/nxsbuild/nxsbuild.pro`
* `src/nxsedit/nxsedit.pro`
* `src/nxsview/nxsview.pro`

can be loaded using QTCreator or using the commandline.

### nxsbuild

```sh
cd src/nxsbuild
qmake nxsbuild.pro
make
```

### nxsedit

In nxsedit.pro and nxscompress.pro, line 20, you might have to

```
replace     unix:INCLUDEPATH += /usr/local/lib
with        unix:INCLUDEPATH += /usr/local/lib /usr/local/include
```

```sh
cd src/nxsedit
qmake nxsedit.pro
make

qmake nxscompress.pro
make
```

### nxsview

In nxsview.pro, line 20, you might have to

```
replace     unix:INCLUDEPATH += /usr/local/lib
with        unix:INCLUDEPATH += /usr/local/lib /usr/local/include /usr/local/Cellar/glew/2.1.0/include
```

```sh
cd src/nxsview
qmake nxsview.pro
make
```
