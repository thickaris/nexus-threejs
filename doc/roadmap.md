##Main issues:

* reparametrization patches for better texture management
* PBR support
* custom mash attributes
* better point cloud rendering and compression
* gltf2.0 format
* unity plugin

* better documentation and tutorials
* add GUI for build and edit.
* clean code

##Small issues:

* 206 partial download required, provide alternatives eg. https://github.com/rvflorian/byte-serving-php/blob/master/byte-serving.php
* improve threejs support (shoadows, better picking)
* use GLBufferAttribute instead of the dirty trick as soon as it's in threejs.
* improve nxsview: copy and paste view parameters for comparing,
* improve nxsview: better visualization of LOD, same for nexus.js
* improve js: improve quality of the rendering when the trackball is not moving.
